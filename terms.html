      <p>12.11 <strong>Assignment.</strong> You may not assign, delegate or transfer these Terms or your rights or obligations hereunder in any way without Clara's prior written consent. We may transfer, assign, or delegate these Terms and our rights and obligations without consent.</p>

      <p>12.13 <strong>Choice of Law; Arbitration.</strong> These Terms are governed by and will be construed under the laws of the United Kingdom. Any dispute arising from or relating to the subject matter of these Terms shall be finally settled in London, United Kingdom, in English.</p>

      <p>12.14 <strong>Miscellaneous.</strong> The failure of either you or us to exercise any right herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary. You and Clara agree that these Terms are the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding between you and Clara.
